# Introduction
This repository demonstrates how to use our [Neodymium library](https://github.com/Xceptance/neodymium-library) to set up a maintainable and well structured test automation project. Furthermore we use the [Wiki](https://github.com/Xceptance/neodymium-template/wiki) on this project to show and explain how to use the features from the Neodymiun library. We also give insight how we think a test automation project should be structured and what results you should get out of it.

## Cucumber
Within this example project we demonstrate how to set up and implement a Cucumber BDD test automation project. You can find information about Cucumber within our [wiki](https://github.com/Xceptance/neodymium-library/wiki/Cucumber).

# Template
If you like our ideas and you would like to start a test automation project using the Neodymium library. We prepared a template that can be used as "Hello World" tutorial and is a good starting point for your own project.

Check out [Neodymium template](https://github.com/Xceptance/neodymium-template).
